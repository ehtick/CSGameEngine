Content:
- add more advanced combat features including magic, blocking, and combos
- add a more sophisticated inventory system including a gui

Engine:
- add fade-in, fade-out, and an rpg-style slowly typing text label.
- move things inside of engine that relate to content, into content folder, so that engine is completely independent of the game itself.
